I am an enthusiastic AI research scientist (Senior Staff Data Scientist) at [GE HealthCare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) Foundation AI group. My research focus on post-training of large vision language model, AI (Multi-) Agents, responsible AI in HealthCare domain for multiple modalities. 

Prior to joining GE HealthCare, I was a Bioinformatics and Computational Biology PhD student at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yun Li](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/yun-li-phd/) and [Dr. Laura Raffield](https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/directory/laura-raffield-phd/). During my PhD study, I majorly focused on using deep learning methods to perform super-resolution for genome interaction data. I developed a convex optimization algorithms for high-dimensional matrices from real datasets (e.g., UK Biobank data) to accelerate linear regression using strong rules and safe rules. I developed a statistical method to perform thousands of association analyses between genome-predicted metabolites and over 800 ICD-10 diseases. In 2023, during my Biostatistics machine learning summer intern at Merck Sharp & Dohme, I was also fortunate to develop a machine learning method for polygenic risk score with genome-environment interaction.
