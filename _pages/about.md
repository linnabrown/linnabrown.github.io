I am an AI research scientist (Senior Staff Data Scientist) at [GE HealthCare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/). My research focus on post-training of large vision language model, AI (Multi-) Agents, responsible AI in HealthCare domain for multiple modalities. 

Prior to joining GE HealthCare, I was Bioinformatics and Computational Biology PhD student at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yun Li](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/yun-li-phd/) and [Dr. Laura Raffield](https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/directory/laura-raffield-phd/). During my PhD study, I majorly focused on using deep learning methods to perform super-resolution for genome data. I developed a convex optimization algorithms for high-dimensional matrices from real datasets (e.g., UK Biobank data) to accelerate linear regression using strong rules and safe rules. I developed a statistical method to perform thousands of association analyses between genome-predicted metabolites and over 800 ICD-10 diseases.

I also was fortunate to have opportunity to develop a method during my Biostatistics machine learning summer intern at Merck Sharp & Dohme. I developed A Fast and Powerful Machine Learning Method for Polygenic Risk Score Prediction by Leveraging Genotype-Environment Interactions, which achived state-of-the-art compared with other GEI methods.
